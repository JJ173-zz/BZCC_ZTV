DEATH RAY - Weapons Technology
__________________________________________________________________________

The 51ers are known to be developing a number of new weapons.

The biggest concern is the Linear Accelerator, also known as a "Death Ray" that has extremely destructive potential. This is located in underground base heavily guarded by automated security systems.

Rocket Pylons guard the more sensitive areas, their laser guided missiles provide good defenses against heavier units.

The rocket silos can be used to deploy defenses for your team if the neutral power has been restored.

Automated Defensive Robots are dispatched by a new class of material carrier rapidly to locations all over the planet.

Mountain top based Savants effectively eliminate the use of a bomber in the center area.

M-curtain mines should prove highly effective against a number of 51er weapons systems.

The Heavy subs known as Sea Patrols or Sea Cows have two torpedoe systems, one of which is very handy for completing the mission. 

The heaviest torpedoe requires a high output infrared source to aquire a lock. This can be provided by solar flares or special IR beacons thats pilots can obtain. 

Undersea work is made easier with a pilot bouancy pack. The spear guns alternate weapon is the IR beacon for missile guidance.
