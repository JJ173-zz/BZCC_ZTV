Welcome to ZTV. World's first ever Mission Team Strat - MPI - Instant hybrid map using ZEEDER's magic dll with mapping by TimeVirus.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

PLAY MODES:
 
Single play alone vs the computer
MPI team play vs the computer
Team1 vs the computer vs Team2
Team1 with Team2 vs the computer
Team vs Team strat

Summary: Get the Death Ray before the other team does.

Select the difficulty level PLUS the human players present. Both settings combine to affect the total difficulty.

When playing allied teams it is best to set players to 8 in the stock selection box and lock the game after 4 players enter. This is to allow proper HUD and F-slot team usage.

Choose "none" for difficulty when playing a Team Strat style of game. When "none" is selected, the player force selection is not in effect and the AI will not be active.

You must restart BZ2 before rejoining if you lag or leave for any reason or bad assets will result. We are still working on this issue.
